Optimization
Welcome to the optimization's programming assignment of the hyper-parameters tuning specialization. There are many different optimization algorithms you could be using to get you to the minimal cost. Similarly, there are many different paths down this hill to the lowest point.

By completing this assignment you will:

- Understand the intuition between Adam and RMS prop

- Recognize the importance of mini-batch gradient descent

- Learn the effects of momentum on the overall performance of your model

This assignment prepares you well for the upcoming assignment.
