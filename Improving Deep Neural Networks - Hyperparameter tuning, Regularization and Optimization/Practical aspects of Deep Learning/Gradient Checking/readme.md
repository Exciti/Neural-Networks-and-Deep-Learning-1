Gradient Checking
Welcome to this week's third programming assignment! You will be implementing gradient checking to make sure that your backpropagation implementation is correct. By completing this assignment you will:

- Implement gradient checking from scratch.

- Understand how to use the difference formula to check your backpropagation implementation.

- Recognize that your backpropagation algorithm should give you similar results as the ones you got by computing the difference formula.

- Learn how to identify which parameter's gradient was computed incorrectly.
