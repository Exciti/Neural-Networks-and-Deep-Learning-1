# Neural-Networks-and-Deep-Learning


## Introduction

This repo contains deep learning projects for [Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). These projects cover different aspects of nerual networks and deep learning, including theories (Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more) and applications (healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing).
