In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy

 By completing this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.
